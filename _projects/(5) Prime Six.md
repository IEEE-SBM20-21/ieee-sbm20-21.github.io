# Prime Six - STM32 Development Board

## Features

The board has 4 layers with dedicated power and ground planes to minimize inductance. The STM32 MCU is a STM32F103RCT6 which strikes a good balance between versatility and cost-effectiveness. We have implemented SPI, I2C, USART, and USB micro for connectivity with a wide range of sensors. There are also 3 channels of 16-bit resolution PWM provided on the board.
The development board also has an ADXL345 accelerometer onboard. This will allow the board to be used with any robotics/drone projects that we might undertake in the future. We have also included a 128 mb flash memory IC to facilitate data logging and allow for larger programs to be run on the device.
