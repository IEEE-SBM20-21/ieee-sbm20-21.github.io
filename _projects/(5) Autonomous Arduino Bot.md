# Realtime Facial Expression Detector

## Features

A dexterous autonomous obstacle avoiding bot which uses 3 HC05 (ultrasonic sensor ) to check for obstacles in its vicinity of about 15-20cm and uses Arduino for its on board computations . It maneuvers itself on detection of obstacle . This Arduino and other sensors are mounted on a metal chasis which is moved by 4 400rpm DC motors to which wheels are connected.
