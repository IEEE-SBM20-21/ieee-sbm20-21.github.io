# Realtime Facial Expression Detector

## Features

An adroit facial expression recognition system that captures your realtime face expression using OpenCV and tensorflow . One of the wide spectrum use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
It captures your face in real time and processes the frame using tensorflow and from an image dataset the model learns what expression it is.
